E-commerce project as capstone project for graduation after the full-stack course at EPICODE.

The site is a retailer of online activation keys for videogames ( and potentially recharge cards or downloadable content for online platforms).
Composed by a main page, product-specific page, search-page, cart and profile (with a register/log-in functionality); it has the basis for a pseudo realistic functionable site.

Technologies used :
  Front-end: 
             -Angular2,
             -Bootstrap and SCSS (for style-sheets)
  Back-end:
            -Java (Spring boot),
            -Postgresql ( as local database)
